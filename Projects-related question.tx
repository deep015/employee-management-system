/**1. Project-Specific Questions
These questions focus on how you designed and implemented the project:

    ~ What inspired you to build this project? What problem does it solve?
        " this project served as a learning opportunity for me to:

        Understand React concepts like components, props, state, and hooks.
        Work with Context API for state management."
    ~ How does role-based authentication work in your project?
                When describing the role-based authentication in your project during an interview, follow this structured approach. Be concise, confident, and clear while demonstrating your understanding of the system's logic and technical details.

            1. Start with the Problem Statement
            "Role-based authentication is a critical feature of my project, the Employee Management System, to ensure that users only access functionalities relevant to their roles. It helps maintain security and clarity in the application."

            2. Explain the Roles and Purpose
            "The system has two main roles:

            Admin: Manages all employees and monitors their tasks.
            Employee: Manages and views their own tasks."
            3. Walk Through the Authentication Flow
            "When a user logs in, the application validates their credentials against predefined data stored in the system.

            If the credentials match the admin account, the user is assigned the 'admin' role.
            If the credentials match an employee record, the user is assigned the 'employee' role.
            This role is then stored in the browser's localStorage to persist the session."
            4. Explain Conditional Rendering
            "The user role determines what dashboard is displayed after login.

            If the user is an admin, they are routed to the Admin Dashboard to perform administrative tasks.
            If the user is an employee, they are directed to the Employee Dashboard, which shows their task details."
            5. Highlight Security Features
            "This ensures secure access because:

            The application uses conditional rendering to prevent users from accessing unauthorized dashboards.
            The localStorage keeps the session active, and invalid users are promptly rejected."
            6. Mention State Management
            "I implemented the Context API to manage user data globally, making it easy for components to access the logged-in user's information without passing props unnecessarily."

            7. Emphasize Logout Functionality
            "The system also supports logout functionality, which clears the user's session from localStorage and resets the role, redirecting the user back to the login page."

            8. Summarize the Key Benefits
            "This approach:

            Keeps the application modular and scalable.
            Ensures data security by restricting access based on roles.
            Provides a seamless user experience for both admins and employees."
            Example Answer for the Interview
            "Role-based authentication in my project is designed to ensure that users can only access what is relevant to their roles. For example, admins can manage all employees and their tasks, while employees can view and manage only their assigned tasks.

            When a user logs in, their credentials are validated. Depending on the match, they are assigned either an admin or employee role, which is stored in localStorage for session persistence. Based on this role, the application renders either the Admin or Employee Dashboard.

            To manage user data globally, I used the Context API, and I implemented a secure logout mechanism that clears the session. This design not only enhances security but also makes the system modular and scalable."


  
    ~ How does your project ensure a good user experience for employees and admins?
    ~ Explain how the task management system categorizes tasks (active, completed, etc.).
    "The task management system categorizes tasks dynamically based on their status
     properties stored in the employee data. Each task has Boolean flags such as 
     active, completed, newTask, and failed to indicate its current state.

    For instance, tasks with active: true are rendered in the 'Active Tasks' section, 
    while tasks with completed: true appear in the 'Completed Tasks' section. The 
    React component-based architecture ensures that each task type is managed
     independently, with the parent TaskList component dynamically rendering the 
     appropriate task components.

   This design makes task management intuitive for users, helping them focus on active
    priorities while maintaining clarity on completed and failed tasks."
    ~ How does the AuthContext work in your application? Why did you use it?
    What is AuthContext?

AuthContext is a context created using React's Context API to manage and provide authentication-related data (e.g., user information, login state) across the application without the need for prop drilling.
How AuthContext Works in Your Application:

Creation:
AuthContext is created using createContext() in the AuthProvider component.
Provider:
The AuthProvider component wraps the application and provides the context values (UserData and setUserData) to all child components.
It uses useState to manage and store UserData fetched from local storage (employees).
Consumption:
Components like App, EmployeeDashboard, or AdminDashboard consume the AuthContext to access user-related data or update it as needed.
The login logic in the App component, for example, checks the user data from AuthContext during authentication.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
const [userData, setUserData] = useContext(AuthContext);
Why Did You Use AuthContext?

Avoid Prop Drilling:
Instead of passing authentication data through props at multiple levels, AuthContext provides a cleaner way to manage and access this data globally.
Simplify State Management:
It allows centralized management of authentication data (UserData), ensuring consistency across all components that rely on user data.
React's Best Practice:
Using Context API for app-wide state, especially for authentication, is a standard approach in React.
Benefits in This Project:

Scalability: If the project grows and more components require authentication data, AuthContext ensures an organized structure without cluttering props.
Reusability: The authentication logic becomes modular and reusable across the application.
Enhanced Code Readability: Developers can easily understand the flow of authentication
